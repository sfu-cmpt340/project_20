## 4. Guidance

- Use [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
    - Do NOT use history re-editing (rebase)
    - Commit messages should be informative:
        - No: 'this should fix it', 'bump' commit messages
        - Yes: 'Resolve invalid API call in updating X'
    - Do NOT include IDE folders (.idea), or hidden files. Update your .gitignore where needed.
    - Do NOT use the repository to upload data
- Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a similarly powerful IDE
- Use [Copilot for free](https://dev.to/twizelissa/how-to-enable-github-copilot-for-free-as-student-4kal)
- Sign up for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/)
